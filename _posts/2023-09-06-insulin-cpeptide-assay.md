The Hoofnagle lab has developed an LC-MS/MS assay to measure insulin and C-peptide without the use of antibodies.

The measurement of insulin and C-peptide provides a valuable tool for the clinical evaluation of hypoglycemia. In research, these biomarkers are used together to better understand hyperinsulinemia, hepatic insulin clearance, and beta cell function.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an attractive approach for the analysis of insulin and C-peptide because the platform is specific, can avoid certain limitations of immunoassays, and can be multiplexed.

Previously described LC-MS/MS methods for the simultaneous quantification of insulin and C-peptide measure the intact analytes and most have relied on immunoaffinity enrichment. These approaches can be limited in terms of sensitivity and interference from auto-antibodies.

We have developed a novel method that does not require antibodies and uses proteolytic digestion to yield readily ionizable proteotypic peptides that enables the sensitive, specific, and simultaneous quantitation of insulin and C-peptide.
