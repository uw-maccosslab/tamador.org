The TaMADOR program was funded with cooperative agreements between the NIDDK and consortium institutions a few years ago, and will now continue with emphasis on the development of assays of importance in type 1 diabetes clinical research.

See the [NIH Request for Applications (RFA-DK-21-031)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DK-21-031.html).

The Principal Investigators leading this effort on type 1 diabetes are:
- **Dr. Andrew Hoofnagle** (University of Washington, Seattle)
- **Dr. Michael MacCoss** (University of Washington, Seattle)
- **Dr. Jun Qu** (University at Buffalo)
- **Dr. Weijun Qian** (PNNL)

Within the RFA we indicated a list of potential targets that the group could be working on, including:
- Glucagon and other pro-glucagon derived peptides
- C-peptide
- Insulin
- Pro-insulin
- Glycated CD59
- Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP)
- Chromogranin A (CgA)
- Chromogranin B (CgB)

We are looking forward to advisory group and community feedback for determining consortium priorities.
