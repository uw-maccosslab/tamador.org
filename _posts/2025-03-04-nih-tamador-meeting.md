The TaMADOR consortium held a symposium at the National Institutes of Health on March 4, 2025: **Biomarkers and Mass Spectrometry–Based Assays in Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research**.

The precise and accurate quantification of proteins and peptides that are involved in diabetes pathogenesis will help facilitate research into disease mechanisms and ultimately improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of patients with diabetes.

During this symposium, members of the TaMADOR consortium provided an overview of recent advances toward this goal, with a special focus on type 1 diabetes. Other speakers highlighted the importance of biomarkers and their harmonization in the study of diabetes and the care of patients with this important chronic disease.
