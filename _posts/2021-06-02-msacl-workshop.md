The TaMADOR consortium held a virtual workshop on June 3, 2021 at the MSACL (Mass Spectrometry: Applications to the Clinical Lab) conference.

This workshop provided an introduction to the TaMADOR program and facilitated discussion of mass spectrometry assays for the obesity and diabetes research community.

The workshop focused on:
- Development of targeted MS assays for diabetes and obesity biomarkers
- Validation strategies for clinical research applications
- Implementation and dissemination of assays across laboratories

This event helped establish connections with the broader clinical mass spectrometry community and gather feedback on assay development priorities.
