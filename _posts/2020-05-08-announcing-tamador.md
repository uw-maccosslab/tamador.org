Two NIDDK programs, one focused on Type 1 Diabetes and one focused on Obesity, are working together to develop and share quantitative protein assays.

- **Type 1 Diabetes:** Andy Hoofnagle's lab at the University of Washington
- **Obesity:** Jenny Van Eyk's and Wei-Jun Qian's labs at Cedars-Sinai and PNNL respectively

To leverage each other's capabilities and strengths we have formed a working group that we call **TaMADOR** (Targeted Mass Spectrometry Assays for Diabetes and Obesity Research).
