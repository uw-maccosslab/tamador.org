# Institution Logos

This directory contains logos for the participating institutions in the TaMADOR consortium.

## Current Logo Files

✅ Logo files present and configured:

1. **UWSOMVert_fullColor_RGB.png** - University of Washington School of Medicine logo
2. **PNNL_CENTER_FullColorSMALL.jpg** - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory logo
3. **Cedars-Sinai.png** - Cedars-Sinai Medical Center logo
4. **University_at_Buffalo_logo.png** - University at Buffalo logo

## Recommendations

- Use PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- Recommended height: 80-120px (width will scale automatically)
- Ensure you have permission to use the institutional logos
- Consider using official logos from each institution's brand guidelines:
  - UW: https://www.washington.edu/brand/graphic-elements/primary-logos/
  - PNNL: Contact their communications office
  - Cedars-Sinai: Contact their communications office
  - Buffalo: https://www.buffalo.edu/brand.html

## Fallback Behavior

If logo files are not present, the website will display text placeholders with the institution name instead. This ensures the site works even without the actual logo images.
